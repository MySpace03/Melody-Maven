<h1>Music Genre Classification on Spotify Data</h1>

Music genre classification using machine learning on Spotify data is a fascinating topic that combines both music and data science. The objective of this task is to develop a model that can automatically predict the genre of a given music track based on its audio features, such as tempo, pitch, timbre, and other characteristics.

Music is like a mirror, and it tells people a lot about who you are and what you care about, whether you like it or not. We love to say “you are what you stream”.

Companies nowadays use music classification, either to be able to place recommendations to their customers (such as Spotify, Soundcloud) or simply as a product (for example Shazam). Determining music genres is the first step in that direction. Machine Learning techniques have proved to be quite successful in extracting trends and patterns from a large pool of data. The same principles are applied in Music Analysis also.
